        <div class="first_verse">
            <p>I'm tired of being what you want me to be <br>
                Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface <br>
                I don't know what you're expecting of me <br>
                Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="bridge">
            <p>Every step that I take is another mistake to you <br>
                (Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)</p>
        </div>

        <div class="choras">
            <p>I've become so numb, I can't feel you there <br>
                Become so tired, so much more aware <br>
                I'm becoming this, all I want to do <br>
                Is be more like me and be less like you</p>
        </div>

        <div class="second_verse">
            <p>Can't you see that you're smothering me? <br>
                Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control <br>
                'Cause everything that you thought I would be <br>
                Has fallen apart right in front of you</p>
        </div>

        <div class="second_brdge">
            <p>Every step that I take is another mistake to you <br>
                (Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow) <br>
                And every second I waste is more than I can take</p>
        </div>

        <div class="second_choras">
            <p>I've become so numb, I can't feel you there <br>
                Become so tired, so much more aware <br>
                I'm becoming this, all I want to do <br>
                Is be more like me and be less like you</p>

        <div class="bridge_choras">
            <p>And I know <br>
                I may end up failing too <br>
                But I know <br>
                You were just like me, with someone disappointed in you</p>
        </div>

        <div class="third_choras">
            <p>I've become so numb, I can't feel you there <br>
                Become so tired, so much more aware <br>
